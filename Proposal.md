# Proposal for the final project
## Repository
https://github.com/AngelBurrito/Final.git

## Description
I want to make a game simliar to the chrome dinosaur game in terms of playstyle, but with more care put into it. This is relevant to media and digital art as the Chrome Dinosaur Game is very bland inn design but it's simple with its graphis so i aim to try and dissect that in a way that feels unique to me to better understand what makes the game so appealing despite being so simple. 

## Features
- Feature 1
- It will have a seamlessly infinite ground level but it is just constantly updating once it is off screen.
- Feature 2
- Will have a character jump. This could be achieved with self.
- Feature 3
- Will have different obstacle elements. Will probably have to use random to achieve this.

## Challenges
- I will need to learn how to draw pixel sprites. I have not made pixel art before and will most likely have to learn a new technique to do so.
- I will need to learn how to implement animated sprites. I've implemented images through python before sure, but animations or images that work as part of a sequence is new.
- I will need to figure out how to make objects interactable. I know in games there is something reffered to as a "hitbox" i wonder if that will be important with this project.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
The ideal outcome is a game where a character jumps up and down while the background scrolls and the character is capable of bein stopped when interacting with objects.

## Milestones

- Week 1
1. Hope to learn how to make pixel art.
2. How to implement pixel art in python.

- Week 2
1. Hope to figure out how to make the background scroll
2. Hope to figure out how to make the character jump

- Week 3
1. Hope to figure out how to add obstacles
2. Hope to figure out how to make the game end when the character hits an obstacle.
