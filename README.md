## Description
I want to make a game simliar to the chrome dinosaur game in terms of playstyle, but with more care put into it. This is relevant to media and digital art as the Chrome Dinosaur Game is very bland inn design but it's simple with its graphis so i aim to try and dissect that in a way that feels unique to me to better understand what makes the game so appealing despite being so simple. 

## Different Files
- Assets - Contains 4 folders
- Butterfly
- Oat
- Other
- Tree
- Each of these folders cantain sprites used in the game, such as the character oatmeal, who is seen running, Butterfly who serves as the flying obstacle, Other which contains the background elements and Tree which contains the different sized Trees obstacle sprites.

## Design Considerations
- I like the two different running positions the character can take based on whether or not you are holding the down button. I do wish i made it so that all 4 limbs move as only the hind two legs move when in the down pose.
- Despite the design being based on the dinosaur game, i'd like to add at least one feature that could help differentiate it more. Such as a powerup or change in the environment
- I would like to add more signifance to the Butterflies, given how important of a role the Butterfly plays in the cartoon this is based on. I could potentially do this by making them a collectible instead of an obsticle.

## Future Areas of Improvement
-I would like to improve on coming up with my own gameplay ideas as because i don't play many video games, i didnt have many ideas which is why i based it on a game i was familiar with.

## Design
As mentioned before the gameplay is designed after the Chrome Dinosaur game, however the art and theme is based on a 2d animated cartoon i have made in the past featued in my youtube channel called Oatmeal and Raisin. I'm glad i designed it after this as it helps relate programming to the genre of animation, given how in the animation world oftentimes popular films and shows get game adaptations. For example Spongeob.
